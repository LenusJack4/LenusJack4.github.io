<h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio.</p>
    
    <h3>SER</h3>
    <p>SER is a selfish, egotistical robot who must go on a journey to repair himself both physically and emotionally. SER was created during the 2020 Global Game Jam where the theme was "repair" and SER won the award for "Best Use of Theme" at the LSU site. This is the first game I created with a team, and I was the sole gameplay/movement programmer for the project. The gameplay was built from scratch and without assistance from tutorials. </p>

    <h3>Super Creative Racecar Game</h3>
    <p>This is the first game that I made entirely by myself and from scratch. This game is a 2D endless runner that procedurally generates as the player continues. As long as the player does not run out of health, they can play forever and keep increasing their score by collecting coins.</p>

    <h3>Galaxy Shooter</h3>
    <p>This game is based off of the classic space shooter games. The player must navigate the ship through enemy fire and shoot enemy ships to rack up score. I made this game with the help of tutorials as I familiarized myself with Unity programming.</p>

    <h3>Block Breaker</h3>
    <p>This is the first game I ever completed. It is a simple game where the player must control a paddle to bounce a ball into blocks to break them, based off of the classic Atari Breakout. It was made with the assistance of tutorials, but I did not like the way the paddle felt to control so I was able to adjust the code to tune the game and paddle behavior to make it feel better more responsive and forgiving to players with slower reflexes without slowing down the game speed itself.</p>
